You can provide your own gene list to focus on them. Please note that gene symbols used in reference genomes could change over time, and you need to examine if your provided gene list utilize the same naming scheme as your data.\n\n\n6.1.0.2 Clusters of interest\nThe clusters to focus on (Find distinct genes within) or to highlight (Plot expression trend).\n\n\n6.1.0.3 Probability threshold to be considered as expressed\nBinomial probability of a gene being expressed in a cluster/cell type . A cutoff is selected here to decide the probability threshold to consider a gene ON.\n\n\n6.1.1 From cluster\nStarting from one cluster, define how consistent among different stages/ conditions you desire for a marker. After clicking Show genes, the consistently expressing genes would be demonstrated and ranked by how many other clusters they are also detected in.\nYou can select a gene, and move forward to Find distinct genes within.\n\n\n6.1.2 From gene\nSimilar to From clustser, but starting from a gene. You define how consistent among different stages/conditions you desire for a marker. After clicking Show clusters, all clusters that consistently express this gene would be shown, and you can choose the clusters that you want to distinguish and move forward to Find distinct genes within. other clusters they are also detected in.\n\n\n6.1.3 Find distinct genes within\nAmong your clusters of interest, find genes that are only ON in one cluster but not others. Use the slide bar to define ON as expressed in at least N stages. Alternatively, use the check boxes to select the stages a gene must be expressed to be considered as ON.\nClick Find genes to visualize how well you can distinguish these clusters with the addition of another gene. You could pick a gene from this list to use together with what you chose in From cluster or From gene.\nYou might want to visualize this gene pair to see how they express in other clusters in the dataset with Co-expression plot.\n\n\n6.1.4 Co-expression plot\nSelect genes that you are interested in, and visualize their co-expression pattern through different stages.\n\n\n6.1.5 Plot expression trend\nThis tool generates an interactive line plot of log-transformed cluster average normalized expression. Cluster label will be shown when you point your cursor to a point. Clusters of interest will be highlighted (and coded with distinct colors when you download a static version of the plot)."
